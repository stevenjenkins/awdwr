== Welcome to Agile Web Development with Rails

I've been a Rails developer for a few years, but I recently picked 
up Agile Web Development with Rails (3rd edition) again, and this
is my git repository for walking through the book again.  You can
also follow along on my blog, http://steven-on-rails.blogspot.com,
if you want to read about my comments as I walk through the book.

Depending on how much fun this is, I may do a walk-through of
the upcoming 4th edition, which will cover Rails 3.
